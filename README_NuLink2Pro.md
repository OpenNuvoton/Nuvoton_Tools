# Nu-Link2-Pro debugging and programming adapter
When using the software development tools above, you may need a USB adapter. 
Here, we introduce a new feature-rich Nu-Link2-Pro adapter to you.

On this page, we will only focus on the feature-rich Nu-Link2-pro. If you wish to learn about other types of Nu-Link, please click the [link](https://www.nuvoton.com/tool-and-software/debugger-and-programmer/1-to-1-debugger-and-programmer/).

### The firmware of the Nu-Link2-Pro adapter
#### All Nu-Link2-Pro firmware binary files can be found [here](./Latest_NuLink_Firmware)  
Users can reprogram Nu-Link2-Pro with another .bin file using the following instructions (Windows OS)  
1. Press the button on Nu-Link2-Pro and plug in the USB cable.
2. The "Nu-Link2-Pro" disk will appear.  (If you see the disk name as "NuMicro MCU", it will upgrade target the device firmware instead of Nu-Link2-Pro itself) 
3. Drag and drop the Nu-Link2-Pro firmware .bin file into the disk.
4. Re-plug the USB cable and it's done.  

#### More options for NuLink2FW (configuration file NU_CFG.TXT)   
#### Warning: The meanings of the options for versions newer than v3.09.7380 are different from those in versions v3.05.7174r to v3.08.7313. For the old settings, please see the old [link](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/Nuvoton_Tools/blob/70dcc9ce06c7d178160c84b870a49d4e9cbf5d1a/README.md).
1. When you upgrade the NuLink2FW.bin to a version greater than or equal to v3.09.7380, you will see some options in NU_CFG.TXT.
* Open the NU_CFG.TXT file in the pop-up "NuMicro MCU" disk

2. For the Nu-Link2-Pro, you will see POWER-MODE and BRIDGE-MODE options. You need to re-plug in the USB cable to activate the setting.
* Set POWER-MODE for SWD output voltage level (mainly for CMSIS-DAP interface use)
    
* Set BRIDGE-MODE=0; this is the default setting. It has a WebUSB interface conforming to the CMSIS-DAP protocol, and you can connect to KEIL Studio Desktop/Cloud via this interface. Note that CMSIS-DAP will be disable in other BRIDGE-MODE (Limited USB endpoints).

* Set BRIDGE-MODE=1; the pass-through bridge function of Nu-Link2-Pro will be enabled (The word Nu-Link2-Bridge will be used to represent the pass-through bridge application on Nu-Link2-Pro adapter). Nu-Link2-Bridge pass-through the data between the VCOM port and I2C/SPI/RS485/CAN interfaces.
    (You will see a "Nu-Link2-Bridge Virtual Com Port" in device manager.)

* Set BRIDGE-MODE=2; a USB HID interface that supports ISPTool will be enabled. This USB HID interface doesn't pass through data, it communicates with ISPTool via HID_ISP and offers I2C/SPI/RS485/CAN interfaces for ISPTool.

* Set BRIDGE_MODE=3; a USB HID interface that supports Boot_Loader_ISPTool will be enabled. This USB HID interface doesn't pass through data, it communicates with Boot_Loader_ISPTool via HID_MKROM_ISP, and offers I2C/SPI/RS485/CAN interfaces for Boot_Loader_ISPTool. (this mode need the firmware later than v3.10)  
Only the NuMicro chip that supports mask ROM Boot Loader (e.g., M460 series) can commnuicate with [Boot_Loader_ISPTool](https://www.nuvoton.com/resource-download.jsp?tp_GUID=SW132022071806572776&currentFolder=/products/microcontrollers/arm-cortex-m4-mcus/m467-ethernet-crypto-series/)  

3. If you use Nu-Link2-ME, it doesn't support BRIDGE functions, and you will only see the CMSIS-DAP option.
* Set CMSIS-DAP=1; this is the default setting. It has a WebUSB interface conforming to the CMSIS-DAP protocol, and you can connect to KEIL Studio Desktop/Cloud via this interface.
* Set CMSIS-DAP=0; it will disable CMSIS-DAP and enable the Nu-Link2 "USB BULK_ICE" interface (it's faster than "USB HID_ICE").


### Comparison of NuLink2FW.bin and NuLink2_DAPLink.bin  
#### [NuLink2FW.bin](./Latest_NuLink_Firmware)
- Proprietary code 
- Support NuMicro 8051, offline programming, encryption during data transmission, unlimited flash break points, NuMicro chip-specific features (config0/config1 dataflash setting, KPROM, etc.)
- USB interfaces: MSC/VCOM/HID_ICE(proprietary commands) or CMSIS-DAPv2 WinUSB + WebUSB CMSIS-DAP/VCOM_Nu-Link2-Bridge or HID_ISP (defined by BRIDGE-MODE of NU_CFG.TXT)

#### [NuLink2_DAPLink.bin](./Latest_NuLink_Firmware)
- Open source: [DAPLink on Nu-Link2-Pro](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/DapLink)  
- Support many third party IDE
- USB interfaces: MSC/CDC/CMSIS-DAPv2 WinUSB/WebUSB CMSIS-DAP
